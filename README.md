# Ludum Dare 30 Game

This is my attempt for the 30th Ludum Dare game jam (48 hours). Due to a lack of inspiration, it became a (sort of generic) coffeescript game engine.

## Running and developing

Have Node.js installed. Run this in the game directory:

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt serve
```

A browser window will open.
